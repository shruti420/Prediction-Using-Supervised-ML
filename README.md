### # Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
_Please click on the images on right side to view my solution._

* Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
* This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
* Data can be found at [http://bit.ly/w](http://bit.ly/w-data)
* You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
* What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

### # Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
_Please click on the images on right side to view my solution._

* From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
* Use R or Python or perform this task.
* Data can be found at [https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox)

### #Task-3 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
_Please click on the images on right side to view my solution._

*Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
* The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
* Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
